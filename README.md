# Churn-Rate-Analysis
This project explores customer satifaction and churn patterns using Power BI and SQL, leveraging real-world business data to identify key drivers of attrition. The analysis includes interactive dashboards and predictive insights to support data-driven decision-making.
**Key Findings:**

**Churn Overview:**
The dashboard reveals a significant number of customers who left within the last month. This trend indicates a pressing need for proactive retention strategies.

**Service Impact:**
Our service breakdown shows that certain combinations—such as high reliance on Internet and Tech Support—appear more prevalent among churned customers. This suggests that reviewing our service bundles could help address potential issues.

**Account Metrics:**
Visualizations indicate that customers with higher monthly charges and a greater volume of technical support tickets tend to churn more frequently. This points toward a need to evaluate our pricing models and improve support efficiency.

**Demographic Insights:**
Demographic analysis shows that specific segments (e.g., younger customers or those without partners) have a higher churn rate. Tailoring retention efforts to these groups could significantly improve our retention outcomes.

**Recommendations:**

**Review Pricing and Service Bundles:**
Consider a reassessment of our pricing strategy and service offerings to identify opportunities for more attractive bundles that better meet customer needs.

**Enhance Customer Support:**
Address the root causes of high technical ticket volumes by enhancing support processes and resources.

**Targeted Retention Strategies:**
Develop tailored retention programs focusing on demographic segments with higher churn rates, ensuring that their specific concerns are proactively addressed.

I believe these steps will help us shift from a reactionary approach to a more predictive, proactive retention strategy.
